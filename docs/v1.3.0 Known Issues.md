# v1.3.0 Known Issues

## Medication Display Bug
**Issue:** Medications in "Upcoming Care" show start date instead of active status
**Impact:** Low - confusing display, but functionality works
**Planned Fix:** v1.3.2
**Solution:** Change medication cards to show "Active" / "Ends in X days" badges instead of dates
**Reference:** Appointments show correctly with date/time, medications need different display logic
```
